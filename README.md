This case of study is the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The scenario presented is that Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago, that gave us the task of analyzing the differences between casual riders and annual members to develop a marketing strategy to convert casual riders into members. Cyclistic's marketing strategy has relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments with flexible pricing plans. However, Cyclistic's director of marketing believes that future growth depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships, as annual members are more profitable than casual riders.
